## The Product Vision

Our project aims to use data analysis and visualization tools to explore the global issue of poverty. By working with real-world data, we want to identify key factors that affect income inequality and living conditions in different regions. Using Python, spreadsheets, and Google Colab, our goal is to combine statistics, visuals, and explanations in one place to help people better understand the causes and impacts of poverty and how data can be used to address these challenges.

## Project Goals

- Analyze poverty-related data
- **Effectively put the data into charts** 

- Use Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn to process data and create clear, meaningful visualizations.

- **Work efficiently as a team** 

- Present findings effectively through a clear and engaging oral presentation supported by visual and data evidence.

## Initial Backlog

- **Choose the focus region and research poverty metrics**

- Identify key variables correlated with poverty levels in certain regions.

- **Create charts for such data**
